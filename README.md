# marble-madness
Marble physics game. Collect coins and test your agility skills by racing through two levels

This was a school project that I decided to have a little bit of fun with and created a rich experience where the ball could travel through different levels, interact with a moving environment, bounce on mushrooms, and race to the finish line.

### How to Run
1. Navigate to the build folder
2. Run marble-madness.exe

### Controls
Arrow keys - Roll marble
WASD - Change camera angle
Space - Stop
